UI:

UI doesnt include classes since we are using react.

API:

ASP.Net Core Web API inclues the following classes:

    1.MarkerController - this controller is responsible for controlling the way that a user interacts with the application.
    A controller determines what response to send back to a user when a user makes a browser request.

    2.MarkerPoint - this model class is responsible for handling data and business logic. 
    A model represents the shape of the data. Model is responsible for handling database related changes.

    3.IMarkerPointServices - This is an interface containing all the methods to be implemented.
    Interfaces add a plug and play like architecture into your applications. Interfaces help define 
    a contract, between the application and other objects.

    4.MarkerPointService - A Service class is used by a client to interact with some functionality in your application, 
    In this case all the MarkerPoints fetching, adding functionality is developed here.
