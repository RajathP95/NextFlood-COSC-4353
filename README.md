# NextFlood-COSC-4353
For the community, real estate and insurance companies, and any Houstonian who needs immediate information about overflowing and critical high-level water in our neighborhoods and localities, the NextFlood is a web application that will help the population be up to date to the second with the floods due to hurricanes and tropical storms that affect us every year. Unlike the Red Cross Flood App, or other apps like FloodWatch, our product is crowd sourced. Users will be able to post geotagged videos, photos, and texts that automatically will be added to our map allowing other users to make independent decisions safely and navigate in response to the flood in real-time increasing the protection of citizens and their belongings.
